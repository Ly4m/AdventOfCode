# Thoughts on the day

Easy and fun one ! Got to play a bit more with the language

## Thoughts on learning/using Rust

* Introduced Struct and Traits to my code
* A bit of extra code due to ownership issue but still 'acceptable'
* Rust constraints weren't an issue this time, I'm kind of getting the hang of it

## What I'd like to improve

* Probably could make this code more concise while still readable

## Visualization Ideas 

* Print all instruction and highlight the current one
* Print accumulator and the current Instruction w/ an ascii representation of the instructions array
