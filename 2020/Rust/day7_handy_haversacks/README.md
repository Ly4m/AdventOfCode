# Thoughts on the day

Easy one when leveraging the HashSet's power

## Thoughts on learning/using Rust

* Discovered the HashSet in Rust
* Couldn't get the code as concise as I'd like to
* Not happy with the use of ``.iter().map(|x| *x)``

## Pseudo code

### Part I

```rustlang
    for every group 
        Add all char to a set
        return the set's lenght
```

### Part II

```rustlang
    for every group
        For every answer
        intersect all answers
        return the intersection lenght 
```
